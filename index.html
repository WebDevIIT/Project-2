      <h1>DNA study IDs descendants of George Washington from unmarked remains, findings to aid service member IDs going back to World War II</h1>
      <p>March 28, 2024 - New DNA sequencing technologies have identified the historical remains of George Washington's grandnephews, Samuel Walter Washington and George Steptoe Washington Jr., and their mother, Lucy Payne Washington, from unmarked, fragmentary bones left at the Harewood family cemetery in Charles Town, West Virginia, in the mid-1800s.</p>

      <h1>Scientists extract genetic secrets from 4,000-year-old teeth to illuminate the impact of changing human diets over the centuries</h1>
      <p>March 27, 2024 - Researchers have recovered remarkably preserved microbiomes from two teeth dating back 4,000 years, found in an Irish limestone cave. Genetic analyses of these microbiomes reveal major changes in the oral microenvironment from the Bronze Age to today. The teeth both belonged to the same male individual and also provided a snapshot of his oral health.</p>

      <h1>ALMA finds new molecular signposts in starburst galaxy</h1>
      <p>March 28, 2024 - The ALMA radio telescope has detected more than 100 molecular species, including many indicative of different star formation and evolution processes, in a galaxy where stars are forming much more actively than in the Milky Way. This is far more molecules than were found in previous studies. Now the team will try to apply this knowledge to other galaxies.</p>
